<!-- CHALLENGE -->
## Challenges

* I tried to reuse the handleKeyup function to the individual keys so that when user clicks on a button, it works same as typing. However, it keeps returning undefined value from Keyboard to the handleKeyup function in the hooks folder.
    * If you know how to fix this issue, please let me know! (I'll really appreciate it)
* I tried to add the animation to the most current row component only by setting id to it, but unfortunately, ids of all row components get changed simultaneously. Hence, it resulted to the case of all components shaking, not the most current row component.
    * I need to make the id static so that the id doesn't change after
* I need to workon responsibility more
    * It still looks very wacky in mobile
    * I need to change the css of icons
